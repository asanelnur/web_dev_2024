      <h1> CINDY WILLIAMS GUTIÉRREZ “THE SMALL CLAIM OF BONES"</h1>
      <p>
         what my body knows <br>
         is not a lie its not <br>
         a lie i tell you it is not <br>
         its nothing short of truth <br>
         and nothing larger <br>
         my past lodges <br>
         in my marrow and if <br>
         i wanted a transplant <br>
